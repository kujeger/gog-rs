gog-rs is a rust library for talking to [GOG's unofficial REST API](https://gogapidocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Many thanks to Yepoleb for the hard work documenting how GOG's API works. This library is written mostly to support [wyvern](https://git,sr,ht/~nicohman/wyvern), but if you want any other endpoints/methods to be implemented, let me know and I'll be happy to add them! This is a mirror for the [sr.ht repository](https://git.sr.ht/~nicohman/gogapi-rs)
